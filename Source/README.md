# Automated measurement of the pulse response duration using computational intelligence


## Task 

 The length of the pulse response shall be measured. The position of the first peak will be known in advance. Therefore at may be assumed that the position of the first   peak is given.
 
 Process the following sub-tasks:

 1. Solve the given task. Write a detailed report including all necessary information for your (fictional) 
    project successor: mathematics, algorithms, software design, source code, test data, test results.
 2. Include a GUI that allows for a choice of a measurement file. The signal shall be plotted, 
    the result (T1: peak position, T2: pulse response duration) shall be displayed both graphically and as a text.
 3. Create a PowerPoint presentation of your algorithm only and submit it together with the project
    report. It will foster your oral presentation.
 4. Give an short oral presentation and/or a demonstration of the project results and participate in
    the subsequent discussion. 
    
    
## Processing hints
    
 Use the template “Template for paper and report”. You can download it from Moodle. In a scientific paper source citation and quoting are mandatory.
 
 The submission deadline is 30th September 2022. Submit the following:
 
 - a digital copy of the project report (WORD file, Moodle upload, by 23.55h),
 - all materials, source code, plans, drawings (personally or Moodle upload, by 23.55h),
 - a PowerPoint presentation (PowerPoint file) or demonstration if it applies.
 
 Presentation dates on individual agreement (in groups). 
 
 Grading: I) presentation (0-4 points); II) task solution, program, project report (0-14 points).
